# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling and analytics

Data Warehouse Project
📌 Overview

This project is focused on building a modern Data Warehouse from scratch using SQL, ETL processes, data modeling techniques, and performing analytical queries to extract meaningful insights. The goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end data pipeline — from raw data ingestion to transformed, queryable, and structured data for business intelligence and reporting.

🛠️ Tech Stack

SQL – For data modeling, transformations, and analytics.

ETL Tools – Python, SQL scripts, or tools like Apache Airflow (optional).

Data Modeling – Star schema, Snowflake schema, dimensional modeling.

Data Warehouse Platform – (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery).

Visualization (Optional) – Power BI, Tableau, or Jupyter Notebooks.

Version Control – Git & GitHub.
